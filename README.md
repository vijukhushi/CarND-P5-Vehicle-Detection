# CarND Vehicle Detection Project

This is the P5 or final project for the Term #1 of Udacity Car Nano Degree. I have been enjoying all these project and this was no different.

### The goals / steps of this project are the following:
  * Perform a Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) feature extraction on a labeled training set of images and train a classifier Linear SVM classifier
  * Optionally, also apply a color transform and append binned color features, as well as histograms of color, to HOG feature vector.
  * Normalize the features and randomize a selection for training and testing the model.
  * Implement a sliding-window technique and use trained classifier to search for vehicles in images.
  * Run pipeline on a video stream (start with the test_video.mp4 and later implement on full project_video.mp4) and create a heat map of recurring detections frame by frame to reject outliers and follow detected vehicles.
  * Estimate a bounding box for vehicles detected.
